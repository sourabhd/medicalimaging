Implementation of Chan-Vese like segmentation algorithm for 3D medical images
=============================================================================

License:

About the code:
--------------
This software implements Chan-Vese like segmentation algorithm based upon level
sets. Major differences are : 1. It uses 'gaussian' curvature, instead of mean
curvature 2. Targeted for 3D objects rather than 2D images.

Requires:
--------
MATLAB

Steps to run
------------
On Matlab prompt:
cd src/
main

main.m contains demos to run the Slicer3D sample data files as well as
synthetic 3D dataset like 3D blobs, 3D solid sphere.


Sample data
-----------
Slicer3D sample data (MR images)  is placed in the data/ directory
This data was obtained from Slicer 3D app :  http://www.slicer.org/
Refer to the website for terms of usage.


Also shipped along with the following third party codes which the software uses:
